\section{System Overview}
We consider a scenario where in a room every smartphone which normally has dual microphone as information receivers%PROBLEM:use complex or singular?
is deployed in a localization system to estimate the location of the acoustic source. When the acoustic source make a sound, smartphone could give us one bit binary information by analyzing duplex sonic signal provided by the dual microphone on the smartphone. If we divied the smartphone into two parts by perpendicular bisector of the dual microphone, the one bit binary information the smartphone gives can tell us which microphone on the smartphone the acoustic source is closer to. We as
