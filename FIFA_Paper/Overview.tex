\section{System Overview}
We consider a scenario where in a room every smartphone which normally has dual microphone as information receivers%PROBLEM:use plurality or singular?
is deployed in a localization system to estimate the location of the acoustic source. When the acoustic source make a sound, smartphone could give us one bit binary information by analyzing duplex sonic signal provided by the dual microphone on the smartphone. The one bit binary information the smartphone gives can tell us which microphone of dual microphone on the smartphone the acoustic source is closer to.
